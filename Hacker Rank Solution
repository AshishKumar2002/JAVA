In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow
Task
Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If  is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
